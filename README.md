## Overview

This is an animated illustration of uranium-235 nuclear fission chain reactions, written in JavaScript using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). The aim is to demonstrate the exponential nature of these reactions as well as the mechanics of splitting atoms to produce neutrons that split more atoms, which produce more neutrons, and so on, releasing energy at every stage.

It mimics real-world physics to a degree; it's far from a realistic simulation. See the comments in `src/skeptch.js` for ways to tune the reactions.

## Try it live

* Play a recent version of the code [here](https://editor.p5js.org/diodesign/full/MJ0Xl8NR) in your browser.
* Tweak and play a recent version of the code [here](https://editor.p5js.org/diodesign/sketches/MJ0Xl8NR) in your browser.

## Future work

* Simulate a reduction in density to show how a mass can go from sub-critical to critical.
* Simulate collision physics of fission byproducts on other atoms.
* Optionally incorporate effects of fission on a secondary stage.

The aim of this project is educational.
